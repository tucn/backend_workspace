## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

## Security Scanning

This project uses automated security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline:

### Tools Used

- **Syft**: Generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for dependency tracking
- **Grype**: Scans container images for known vulnerabilities
- **Copa**: Automatically patches vulnerabilities when possible

### Scan Schedule

- **Automated**: On every push to main/develop branches
- **Scheduled**: Weekly scans every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process

1. **Automated Detection**: Vulnerabilities are automatically detected by Grype
2. **Severity Assessment**: Each vulnerability is categorized by severity level
3. **Auto-Patching**: Critical and High severity issues are automatically patched when possible
4. **Manual Review**: Medium and Low severity issues are flagged for manual review

### Severity Levels

- **ðŸ”´ Critical**: Immediate action required, potential for complete system compromise
- **ðŸŸ  High**: Significant security risk, should be addressed promptly
- **ðŸŸ¡ Medium**: Moderate risk, should be addressed in regular maintenance cycles
- **ðŸŸ¢ Low**: Minimal risk, informational purposes

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Update Frequency |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours     | Daily           |
| High     | 72 hours     | Every 3 days    |
| Medium   | 1 week       | Weekly          |
| Low      | 1 month      | Monthly         |

## Auto-Patching with Copa

### What Gets Patched

- **Automatic**: Critical and High severity vulnerabilities
- **Manual Review**: Medium and Low severity vulnerabilities
- **Excluded**: Kernel-level packages, core system libraries

### Patch Strategy

- **Minimal Patching**: Only necessary security updates are applied
- **Version Control**: All patches are tracked and versioned
- **Rollback Support**: Previous image versions remain available

### Patch Verification

1. **Automated Testing**: Patched images undergo automated security tests
2. **Functional Testing**: Basic functionality is verified
3. **Security Validation**: Re-scanning confirms vulnerability resolution

## Security Best Practices

### Development

- Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `go mod audit`)
- Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Use multi-stage Docker builds to minimize attack surface
- Implement least privilege principle in container configurations

### Deployment

- Use signed container images when possible
- Implement image scanning in deployment pipelines
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in production images
- Regular security updates and patch management

### Monitoring

- Continuous vulnerability monitoring
- Automated alerting for new security issues
- Regular security assessment and penetration testing
- Incident response procedures

## Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security researchers are encouraged to report issues
- We commit to acknowledging reports within 48 hours
- Public disclosure follows coordinated disclosure timeline

### Timeline

- **Initial Response**: 48 hours
- **Status Update**: 1 week
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (see response timeline above)
- **Public Disclosure**: 30 days after resolution (or as coordinated)

## Compliance

This security policy aligns with:
- OWASP Security Guidelines
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 Information Security Management
- SOC 2 Type II Compliance Requirements

## Updates

This security policy is reviewed and updated quarterly. Last updated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
